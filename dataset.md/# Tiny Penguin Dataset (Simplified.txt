# Tiny Penguin Dataset (Simplified Example)

These are rough average measurements that inspired the simple rules:

| Species    | Bill Length (mm) | Bill Depth (mm) |
|----------- |------------------|-----------------|
| Adelie     | 38               | 19              |
| Chinstrap  | 48               | 18              |
| Gentoo     | 50               | 15              |

These values are only for practice and are not scientific.
