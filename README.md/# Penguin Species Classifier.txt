# Penguin Species Classifier

This is a simple Python project I made while learning programming.

The program asks the user for two numbers:
- bill length
- bill depth

Then it uses simple if/else rules to guess the penguin's species.

This helped me practice:
- user input
- variables
- lists and dictionaries
- if and elif conditions

To run the program:
1. Open a terminal
2. Type: python penguin_classifier.py
